          <strong>III. How We Secure Your Information</strong>
        </p>
        <p className="whitespace-pre-wrap">
          We maintain commercially reasonable administrative, physical and
          technical safeguards designed to prevent any unauthorized use, access,
          destruction, loss, alteration, or disclosure of your data.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p className="whitespace-pre-wrap">
          If you submit a credit card payment through our Services, for example
          to purchase insurance coverage, we do <strong>not</strong> store
          credit card information on our own servers or associate it with your
          account information for any purpose other than completing your
          purchase.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p className="whitespace-pre-wrap">
          If you submit bank account information, for example to purchase
          insurance coverage, that bank information is encrypted, stored on our
          servers in encrypted form, and is accessed and used to complete your
          insurance application or purchase.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p className="whitespace-pre-wrap">
          If you submit credit card or other payment information via DocuSign,
          it will be temporarily stored in encrypted form on DocuSign’s servers,
          and we will use the payment information to securely transmit your
          payment information to the carrier.
        </p>
        <p className="whitespace-pre-wrap">
          While we take commercially reasonable steps to protect your data we{" "}
          <strong>cannot</strong> guarantee perfect security – no internet-based
          service can. No security system is impenetrable. Despite our security
          measures, we <strong>cannot</strong> guarantee the security of our
          databases, nor can we guarantee that the information you supply will
          not be intercepted while being transmitted to and from us over the
          Internet.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p className="whitespace-pre-wrap">
          <strong>IV. Users From Outside The U.S.</strong>

          information will be maintained in the U.S. and in other locations
          where we may process data.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p className="whitespace-pre-wrap">
          By default, we disable the submission of personal information to our
          Sites from users using European Union and United Kingdom IP addresses.
          If you need access to your account and are using an E.U. or U.K. IP

          <strong>V. Children</strong>
        </p>
        <p className="whitespace-pre-wrap">
          We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under
          the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not give us any personal
          information and do not use the Sites or Services. If you have reason
          to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided personal
          information to us, please contact us immediately, and we will delete
          that information from our databases.
        </p>
        <p className="whitespace-pre-wrap">
          <strong>VI. Pet Information</strong>

          We collect information about your pet(s) including, but not limited
          to, your pet's name, breed, gender, weight, age and health history (“
          <strong>Pet Information</strong>”). You understand and agree that such
          information about your pet is not deemed personal information, is not
          "Information" as that term is defined here under, and is not
          confidential or proprietary to you. PIPA is not responsible for
          securing any information that you provide us about your pet(s) or for
          processing any such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy
          or otherwise. If you desire to keep any information about your pet
          private, do not share such information with PIPA.

        <p className="whitespace-pre-wrap">
          The Sites may contain links to third-party websites, including,
          without limitation, the websites of the insurance carriers offering
          the third-party insurance products made available to you through the
          Services (“<strong>External Sites</strong>”), but we do not endorse,
          and we are not responsible for the content of any linked External
          Sites or for the privacy practices of the third parties that own and
          operate such sites. Before using any External Site, please refer to
          the terms of use and privacy policies of the External Sites for more
          information, as those terms and policies govern your use of such
          External Sites.
