            Okay, cool! So, what is pet insurance?
          </h4>
          <p className="whitespace-pre-wrap">
            Think of pet insurance as a safety net for your furry friend's
            health. Just like our health insurance, it helps cover unexpected
            medical expenses for your pet. If your dog swallows something they
            shouldn't or your cat develops a sudden illness, pet insurance can
            help manage the vet bills. You pay a monthly premium, and in return,
            the insurance reimburses you for covered veterinary costs.

            How does pet insurance work?

          <p className="whitespace-pre-wrap">
            Well, here’s how it works in a short list:

            <li>
              <p className="whitespace-pre-wrap">
                <strong>Pay Upfront</strong>: When your pet needs care, you pay
                the vet directly.

            </li>
            <li>
              <p className="whitespace-pre-wrap">
                <strong>Submit a Claim</strong>: Send the bill to your insurance

                <strong>Get Reimbursed</strong>: After meeting your deductible,
