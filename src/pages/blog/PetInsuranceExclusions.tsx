        What Pet Insurance Doesn’t Cover and How to Protect Your Pet
Anyway
Understanding what isn’t covered by pet insurance is just as important as knowing what is. At PIPA
Broker, we believe in transparency so you can choose coverage that suits your pet’s needs and your
peace of mind.

1. Pre-Existing Conditions
What doesn’t get covered: Any illness or injury that appeared before your policy began (or during any
waiting period) is typically excluded. This includes undiagnosed symptoms like limping or excessive
licking, which insurers often classify as existing conditions. 1,2
How to work around it:
 Enroll early, ideally when your pet is young and healthy, to minimize risk.
 Some policies allow coverage for curable pre-existing conditions after a symptom-free waiting
period (e.g., 180 days), but will still exclude incurable or chronic issues like diabetes or allergies. 1
 AKC Pet Insurance is unique in that it offers coverage for both curable and incurable pre-existing
conditions. But only after 365 days of uninterrupted coverage. 3

2. Waiting Periods
What to expect: No coverage for conditions that arise within the policy’s early days or weeks, often 14
to 30 days for illnesses, with shorter waiting periods for accidents. Some complex conditions, like hip
dysplasia, may require up to 12-month waiting periods. 4
Why it matters: A pet getting injured or sick immediately after enrollment could be denied coverage
due to this built-in delay.

3. Routine, Preventive, and Elective Care
What’s excluded:
 Regular checkups, vaccinations, grooming, spaying/neutering, and flea or tick treatments are
generally not included in basic accident or illness policies. 4
 Elective or cosmetic procedures (e.g., declawing, tail docking, or aesthetics) are also excluded.
Workaround: Add a wellness or preventive care plan if available, especially if your pet receives
frequent routine treatments.

4. Hereditary, Congenital, and Bilateral Conditions
Coverage varies:
 Many policies exclude hereditary or congenital conditions (like hip dysplasia or heart disease)
unless they’re specifically included or added as riders. 2
 Bilateral conditions (e.g., hip dysplasia that first appears on one side and then the other) are
typically excluded if one side was affected before coverage. 1
PIPA Broker’s tip: Use free tools &amp; resources like PIPA Broker to find insurance that doesn’t exclude
conditions your pet is genetically predisposed to.

5. Other Common Exclusions
Additional exclusions may include:
 Pregnancy and birthing-related expenses
 Claim administration fees, such as vet charges for completing forms or obtaining medical
records
 Breed-specific or age-specific limitations, caps, or fees.
