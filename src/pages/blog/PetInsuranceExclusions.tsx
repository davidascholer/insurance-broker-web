          What Pet Insurance Doesn't Cover and How to Protect Your Pet Anyway
        </h1>
        <p>
          Understanding what isn't covered by pet insurance is just as important
          as knowing what is. At PIPA Broker, we believe in transparency so you
          can choose coverage that suits your pet's needs and your peace of
          mind.

              Pre-Existing Conditions
            </h2>
            <p>
              <strong>What doesn't get covered:</strong> Any illness or injury
              that appeared before your policy began (or during any waiting
              period) is typically excluded. This includes undiagnosed symptoms
              like limping or excessive licking, which insurers often classify
              as existing conditions.
            </p>
            <h3 className="text-(--primary-teal-dark) text-xl sansita-bold">
              How to work around it:
            </h3>
            <ul className="list-disc ml-5 space-y-2">
              <li>
                Enroll early, ideally when your pet is young and healthy, to
                minimize risk.
              </li>
              <li>
                Some policies allow coverage for curable pre-existing conditions
                after a symptom-free waiting period (e.g., 180 days), but will
                still exclude incurable or chronic issues like diabetes or
                allergies.
              </li>
              <li>
                AKC Pet Insurance is unique in that it offers coverage for both
                curable and incurable pre-existing conditions. But only after
                365 days of uninterrupted coverage.
              </li>
            </ul>

              Waiting Periods
            </h2>
            <p>
              <strong>What to expect:</strong> No coverage for conditions that
              arise within the policy's early days or weeks, often 14 to 30 days
              for illnesses, with shorter waiting periods for accidents. Some
              complex conditions, like hip dysplasia, may require up to 12-month
              waiting periods.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Why it matters:</strong> A pet getting injured or sick
              immediately after enrollment could be denied coverage due to this
              built-in delay.
            </p>

            <ul className="list-disc ml-5 space-y-2">
              <li>
                Regular checkups, vaccinations, grooming, spaying/neutering, and
                flea or tick treatments are generally not included in basic
                accident or illness policies.
              </li>
              <li>
                Elective or cosmetic procedures (e.g., declawing, tail docking,
                or aesthetics) are also excluded.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong>Workaround:</strong> Add a wellness or preventive care
              plan if available, especially if your pet receives frequent
              routine treatments.

            <ul className="list-disc ml-5 space-y-2">
              <li>
                Many policies exclude hereditary or congenital conditions (like
                hip dysplasia or heart disease) unless they're specifically
                included or added as riders.
              </li>
              <li>
                Bilateral conditions (e.g., hip dysplasia that first appears on
                one side and then the other) are typically excluded if one side
                was affected before coverage.
              </li>
            </ul>
