        Understanding Pet Insurance Types with PIPA Broker
When it comes to protecting your furry companion, pet insurance offers different levels of coverage so
you can tailor protection to your pet’s needs and your budget.
1. Accident-Only Plans
These plans are your budget-friendly safety net for unexpected injuries. Think broken bones, lacerations,
poisonings, or foreign-object ingestion. Some policies may cover diagnostics, hospitalization,
medications, or surgery related to these accidents. 1,2
Why choose it?
 Lower premiums make it a popular choice for younger, healthy pets or older pets limited to this
coverage.
 Straightforward and simple coverage for emergencies. 1
What’s missing:
 No coverage for illnesses, chronic conditions, or preventive care.
2. Accident-and-Illness (Comprehensive) Plans
The most comprehensive option, this plan covers a wide range, including infections, chronic or
hereditary conditions, diagnostic testing, emergency care, and hospitalization. 3,4
Why choose it?
 Peace of mind with robust coverage that grows with your pet’s needs.
 Helpful for pets susceptible to chronic or breed-specific ailments. 1
Key considerations:
 Higher premium cost, plus potentially complex exclusions like elective procedures or specific
limits.
 Preventive care and pre-existing conditions are usually excluded. 5
3. Wellness Add-Ons (Preventive Care Plans)
Wellness or preventive care coverage is not a standalone policy but an optional add-on to cover routine,
predictable costs, like vaccinations, annual exams, dental cleanings, microchipping, or heartworm
prevention. 2,4
Why choose it?
 Helps budget for regular care while you focus on your pet’s long-term health.
What to keep in mind:
 Coverage is often in fixed amounts per service; weigh those against actual vet costs to ensure
value.
