        The Real Cost of Pet Insurance: What It Costs and What Drives It
At PIPA Broker, we believe in transparency and data driven decision making. Let’s explore the average
costs of pet insurance for dogs and cats in 2025, what influences those premiums, and how you can
make cost-effective, tailored choices for your furry family members.

1. Average Pet Insurance Costs (2025)
 The North American Pet Health Insurance Association (NAPHIA) reports a similar ballpark: dogs
average $62.44/month ($749/year); cats average $32.21/month ($386/year). 1
 MetLife data aligns closely: $60/month for dogs and $32/month for cats, noting extremes by
breed, such as French Bulldogs at $92/month and Labradors at $62/month. 2
 Bankrate, drawing from 2024 NAPHIA figures, puts average A&amp;I premiums at $56.30/month for
dogs and $31.94/month for cats. 3
 NerdWallet confirms: dogs average $62/month, cats $32/month. Accident-only policies run
lower at about $16/month for dogs, $9/month for cats. 4

2. What Drives Pet Insurance Premiums?
Multiple factors shape those numbers. Here’s how each one plays into your monthly cost:
- Species, Size &amp; Breed
 Dogs cost more to insure than cats: higher activity and injury risk. 5
 Breed matters: Health predispositions and physical size affect vet expenses. Larger breeds or
those prone to genetic conditions, like hip dysplasia, carry higher premiums.
- Age
 Younger pets cost less to insure. As pets age, claims likelihood rises—pushing premiums upward.
- Location
 Higher regional veterinary costs = higher premiums. Urban areas or regions with cutting-edge
care tend to be pricier. 5
- Coverage Choice
 Accident-only plans are significantly cheaper (e.g., $16/month for dogs vs. $62/month for full
A&amp;I).
 Accident &amp; Illness (A&amp;I) coverage is more robust and therefore more expensive.
- Deductible, Reimbursement &amp; Limits

 Higher deductibles = lower premiums; higher reimbursement rates and limits = higher
premiums. Customizing these can shift the cost significantly.
- Health History &amp; Pre-existing Conditions
 Pre-existing or chronic conditions lead to exclusions or higher rates, even if they aren&#39;t covered,
as the presence of these are highly correlated with required vet visits in the future.
- Insurer &amp; Discounts
 Each company underwrites differently. Bundles, multi-pet discounts, employer programs can
lower rates.

4. PIPA Broker’s Smart Budgeting Tips
 Start young: Insuring puppies/kittens locks in lower premium rates.
 Compare apples to apples: Use tools like PIPA Broker to compare real-time quotes tailored by
breed, age, and location.
 Trim by choice: Accident-only saves money, but consider A&amp;I for long-term health protection.
 Adjust thoughtfully: Tweak deductible, reimbursement, and annual limits to balance monthly
outlay and risk.
 Bundling benefits: Check for employer or existing-insurance discounts.

 Review annually: As your pet and their health evolve, reassess to keep coverage fair and
affordable.

Final Word from PIPA Broker
Pet insurance is more than a monthly payment. It is thoughtful preparation for your pet’s wellbeing and
your peace of mind. While averages give you a baseline like $60 to $62/month for dogs, and $30 to $32
for cats, the real cost depends on your pet, your policy, and your priorities.
