        Understanding Pet Insurance &amp; How It Works with PIPA Broker
What is Pet Insurance?
Pet insurance is a financial safety net designed to help pet owners manage the costs of veterinary care.
It operates on a reimbursement model, where you pay the vet upfront and then submit a claim to your
insurance provider for eligible expenses. Coverage typically includes accidents, illnesses, and sometimes
preventive care, depending on the policy.
How Pet Insurance Works
1. Choose a Policy: Use PIPA Broker’s tool to help find &amp; compare pet insurance options, then
select the plan that fits your pet’s needs and your budget.
2. Pay Premiums: After selecting and purchasing the right policy, pay monthly or annual premiums
to keep the policy active.
3. Visit Any Licensed Vet: Most policies allow you to visit any licensed veterinarian.
4. Pay Vet Bills Upfront: After treatment, pay the vet directly.
5. Submit a Claim: Send the invoice and any required documentation to your insurer.
6. Receive Reimbursement: The insurer reimburses you for covered expenses, minus any
deductibles or co-pays.
Types of Coverage
 Accident-Only: Covers injuries like fractures or ingestion of foreign objects.
 Accident and Illness: Includes coverage for diseases such as cancer or infections.
 Wellness Plans: Optional add-ons for routine care like vaccinations and dental cleanings.

Key Considerations
 Deductibles: The amount you pay out-of-pocket before insurance kicks in.
 Reimbursement Rates: Typically range from 70% to 90% of covered costs.
 Coverage Limits: Some policies have annual or lifetime caps on payouts.
 Pre-existing Conditions: Most policies do not cover conditions that existed before the policy
started.
 Understand Exclusions: It’s extremely important to understand what is excluded in the policy
before you purchase one for your furry pal. For a comprehensive understanding of common pet
