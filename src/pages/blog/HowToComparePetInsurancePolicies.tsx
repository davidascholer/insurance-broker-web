        Choosing Pet Insurance with PIPA Broker: Smart, Clear, Free
Adding insurance to your pet care plan is one of the most responsible financial decisions you can make.
Let’s break it down in a way that fits PIPA Broker’s spirit: simple, financially sound, and always putting
your pet first.
1. Comparing Plans: See Clearly, Choose Confidently
When evaluating pet insurance policies, start by comparing core features since not all coverage is
created equal:
What to Watch For:
 Coverage Types: Make sure you’re looking at accidents, illnesses, hereditary or congenital
conditions, chronic issues, diagnostics, surgeries, medications, and behavioral treatments. Some
plans even offer routine or wellness add-ons. 1 For more on coverage types, visit our blog post
that explains all about their differences.
 Exclusions &amp; Waiting Periods: Understand what’s not covered. Pre-existing conditions, breed-
specific exclusions, age limits, or waiting periods (which can stretch from days to months) can
significantly affect what your pet can claim.
 Costs &amp; Caps: Compare premiums, deductibles (annual vs. per-incident), reimbursement levels,
and annual or lifetime benefit limits. 1
 Service Quality: Choose providers known for smooth, quick claims, flexible contact options, and
strong customer support. 1
Tools &amp; Strategies:
 Use free pet insurance comparison tools and services like PIPA Broker to compare multiple
plans side-by-side, tailored to breed, age, and location.
 If you really want to be organized like us at PIPA, track quotes in a spreadsheet: compare
coverage scores, prices, and value metrics. Read about the differences in claim handling,
customer service, and reviews on each carrier.
 Let’s face it, we all want to save on money spent these days, but don’t forget the old saying:
You get what you pay for. Check how easy it is to file a claim. A fast payout could mean
everything in an emergency, even if it just a bit more costly per month or year.
2. Policy Types: Tailor to Your Pet’s Needs (and Your Wallet)
Pet insurance comes in several flavors and each fits a different level of care and comfort:
 Accident-Only: Lower-cost, covers unexpected injuries like fractures or ingestion events.
 Accident + Illness: A balance between cost and comprehensive care. This often covers common
illnesses alongside accidents.

 Wellness Add-Ons: Optional coverage for routine care like vaccinations, dental cleanings, and
checkups.
PIPA Broker Tip: Start with a solid Accident + Illness policy and layer in wellness coverage if your budget
allows. Be sure the extra cost brings real value for your pet, though!
3. Enrollment Timing: Get In Early, Stay Protected
The biggest rule of thumb that can save you real dollars on vet costs? Enroll early.
Why Start Early?
 Avoid Pre-existing Conditions: Vet visits can uncover issues that might not be covered later.
Starting before your pet’s first checkup keeps their slate clean. 2
 Lower Premiums: Young, healthy pets cost less to insure and policies may stay more affordable. 3
 Shorter Waiting Periods: Many providers offer just a few days (for accidents) and a few weeks
(for illnesses). The earlier you enroll, the quicker your coverage begins. 3,4,5
 Seasonal Hazards? Stay Covered: If weather-related issues like heatstroke or hypothermia are a
concern, plan ahead to be protected before the high-risk season hits.
Even if your pet is older, enrolling sooner rather than later still reduces risk. Many insurers will still cover
pets up to age 14. Just note that older or already-treated pets may face exclusions or higher costs.
