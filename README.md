- **ESLint:** Linting rules are defined in `eslint.config.js`.

## Adding a page to the project

- Create the new page
  - Copy and paste the SamplePage.tsx file located at `src/pages/SamplePage.tsx`
  - Rename `SamplePage copy.tsx` to a name you desire e.g. `YourNewPage.tsx`
  - Not required but recommended, change the name inside SamplePage.tsx to YourNewPage i.e. `export default function YourNewPage() {...`
  - Edit the contents of MyNewPage.tsx to whatever you want.
- Add the new page to the router
  - locate and open the file at `src/AppRouter.tsx`
  - add `import YourPageName from "./pages/YourPageName";` to the top of the file with the other imports
  - add `<Route path="/your-route-page" element={<YourPageName />} />` inside of the `<Routes>`
- Your new page will now be accessible at `/your-new-page` e.g. `http://localhost:5173/sample-page` or `https://pipabroker.com/sample-page` when live on dev/production
